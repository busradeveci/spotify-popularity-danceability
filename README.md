# Spotify Popularity and Danceability Analysis

## About
Welcome to the **Spotify Popularity and Danceability Analysis** repository! This project aims to analyze the relationships between musical features, specifically focusing on the connection between **popularity** and **danceability**. By utilizing Spotify's vast dataset, I visualized how these factors are interconnected.

Using data analysis techniques, I identified key patterns that help understand which features make a song popular or danceable. This analysis could be useful for data scientists, musicians, or playlist creators.

## Project Summary
In this project, I used Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to perform data processing and visualization on the **Spotify dataset**. Key features like **danceability**, **energy**, **tempo**, and **popularity** were analyzed in various ways to gain insights into musical preferences.

- **Key Visualizations**:
  - A **scatter plot** showing the relationship between **popularity** and **danceability**.
  - A **heatmap** visualizing the correlation between different musical features.
